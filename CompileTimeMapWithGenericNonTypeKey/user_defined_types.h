 * Providing branching capabilities to the Compile-Time-Variadic Map posted in code project article:
 *      [ http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/598107/Compile-Time-Map ]
 * to enable differential treatment for the mapped and the unmapped data. The construct is widely
 * being used in more organizations now and this capability is now highly called for. This is a POC
 * for the same.
